### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[Projects](https://officewires.azurewebsites.net/)


I am Dan. The link above (https://officewires.azurewebsites.net) is to an MVC web app hosted on Microsoft Azure cloud platform that was written as an automated portfolio tool to catalog public repositories for any Github user. By default, it opens mine.  The icons associated with each are extracted from the first image found in the repository's README.md file, and the demo web link withing the context menu is also populated by polling the README.md contents.

Most of the public repositories here are from classroom demonstrations and other projects, intended to be shared with students.

Examples here are primarily C#, Java, Javascript, html/css, and Azure configuration documents.
